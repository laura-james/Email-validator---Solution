# Instructions  

## Email validator 
Make a program to check whether an email address is valid or not.

- make sure that there are no spaces,
- that there is an @ symbol
- and a dot somewhere after it.
## Extensions
- check the length of the parts at the start,
- and that the end parts of the address are not blank
- When an email address is found to be invalid, tell the user exactly what they did wrong with their email address rather than just saying it is invalid
- Allow the user to choose to give a text file with a list of email addresses and have it process them all automatically.
